# The Class Directory Extravaganza

## Description

Following the instructions given below, you will have until the end of the working day to try and build a fully functioning API complete with the standard CRUD routes.
Hopefully by now all of you have an express start up cheat sheet. Use that to get you going.

## Attempt to accomplish before the end of the day


* Create a database locally

* Build your own express server

* Create your own schema

* Build your seeds

* Build your routes

  * get
  * get by id
  * post
  * put
  * delete

* Build your queries

* Test routes in postman and in client

* Deploy your app to heroku

## Notes

I don't care if you work with somebody else, in groups or alone. Just make sure you are using this opportunity to learn.

Read your errors and remember, if something isn't doing what you think it should, then you probably missed a step. Go slow.

Try and maintain that growth mindset and if you get frustrated just take breaks.

Patrick and I are deliberately leaving yall to your own devices for a few hours today. Figure things out by yourselves or in groups.

If you finish this in record time, there are so many concepts you can dive further into (error handling, cors, headers, etc..) please do so. I also made a front end for this in vanilla JS. If you get everything up and deployed I will slack you the code and you can check out how the front end operates!

## Final Thoughts/hints

* All of you should know by now where to look for help if you get stuck. Hopefully you all have that cheat sheet I have been encouraging you to build ðŸ˜‡ if not, now might be a great time to make one.

* PUSH EARLY AND OFTEN

* DONT FORGET THOSE ENV'S AND GITIGNORES

* Take things one step at a time

* Check out knex.js/ express.js/ PSQL docs if you need halps

* Have fun with it
